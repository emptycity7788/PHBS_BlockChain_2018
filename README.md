# Research on the Impact of Blockchain on the Business Model of Payment Industry - Based on Blockchain Applications
## 1.	Possibility of Block Chain Application in Payment Industry and Comparison with Traditional Payment
Block chain technology, originating from Bitcoin proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, is a bottom application technology of Bitcoin and also known as distributed book-keeping technology. Block chain refers to a technical scheme that collectively generates a series of ordered data blocks by means of mathematical algorithms in the way of de-centralization and de-trust, and constitutes a reliable database. The scheme allows any number of user nodes in the system to compute and record data for a period of time through a specific cryptographic algorithm into a data block, and to use the keys generated by the data block to link and verify the next data blockchain. 

Block chain technology, as the underlying technology support, has a huge possibility and potential to integrate with payment means and even bring huge changes to them. This possibility mainly stems from its characteristics of decentralization, de-trust and de-risk. It can well solve the problems of high network security risk, low credit, lack of legal supervision and high payment cost in current electronic payment industry. Specifically speaking, the following points demonstrate its main potentials.
* Blockchain-based electronic payment system can help realize trust interaction between transaction parties under block-chain digital signature technology, bypassing information intermediary through peer-to-peer transaction.
* Blockchain, using intelligent contract instead of traditional contract, can help avoid contract execution accidents caused by human emotional factors.
* Blockchain can help overall supervision and realize intelligent supervision through credit information management system, and also simplify electronic payment process. 
* Block chains can help achieve high security and user protection. Based on the characteristics of distributed bookkeeping in block chain, the work related to privacy and security, such as authentication, proof of rights and interests, intelligent assets, etc., can be effectively reformed.
If the blockchain-based payment system could be achieved finally, the system should be as shown in the following figure:

Compared with traditional payment system, blockchain-based payment system mainly has following features. 
* **Decentralization**: at present, almost all data management systems adopt centralization mode, with data recording and storing centralized into a data center for unified management. The blockchain technology is distributed recording and storage and each node has the same power. There is no centralized hardware or no third-party management organization. Each node is independent and could not damage the overall situation.
* **High transparency**: the data confidentiality of traditional data systems is high because only specific managers or the owners themselves can view the whole or part of the transaction data. But for blockchain-based payment system, all data information and operation rules are public, transparent and permanent.
* **Anonymous autonomy**: Block chains rely on key technology to form a trust mechanism, where participants don’t need to know the credibility of the other party, nor do they need third-party institutions to provide guarantees or intermediaries. They can complete transactions independently by relying on algorithms. In the whole transaction process, each node can be anonymous, but it can establish trust independently, and realize data recording and exchange safely.
* **High security**: In the traditional payment system, if as the center institution meet problems, the whole system will be broken. But blockchain technology is distributed accounting, where each node can copy the database completely but can’t modify the data independently. If the hacker intends to destroy the whole block chain, he will first need to control more than 51% of the nodes in the control system, which is extremely difficult in reality and will generate tremendous costs. As the number of nodes in the system increases, the data security will be higher.

## 2.	Application of Blockchain-based Payment System - Ripple
Nowadays, many institutions worldwide have carried out relevant research and exploration due to the optimization effect of block chain technology on payment system. For example, UBS has set up the Block Chain Finance Research and Development Laboratory, which mainly explores the future development of Block Chain in payment and settlement mode. In this part, I’ll mainly focus on Ripple Payment Network and try to explore the current situation and development principle.
### 2.1 Brief Introduction
The earliest history of RipplePay can be traced back to 2004, when Ryan Fugger, a software developer in Canada, invented RipplePay protocol for Internet payment. In 2012, the company was officially established as OpenCoin, which was later renamed as Ripple lab. Ripple then started to develope a new payment Protocol called Ripple Transaction Protocol which has following features:
* Instant and direct transfer between users, without any intermediary.
* Different kinds of currency available in payment and transfer, for example dollar, euro, yen, RMB, gold, air mileage and so on
* Developed based on the blockchain technology and has a common ledger maintained by the servers in the network. 
* Launch its own digital currency, XPR, based on the blockchain, to help financial institutions transfer money, same as Bitcoin.

In September 2013, the company officially changed its name to Ripple and announced all of its servers and clients were open source, which is the first distinction between the open source community and the company. Ripple has been developed from a payment protocol into an ecosystem, realizing the new structure of open-source software belonging to the community, Ripple company which provides commercial products and digital currency Ripple coin XRP (see the figure below. All three operate a Ripple blockchain, known as RippleNet.

![](https://github.com/joooyyy/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/Figure3Ecology.png)

The Ripple Ecological Ecology consists of three levels: the first level is the abstract global payment protocol RipplePay; the second level includes open source software, Ripple company and Ripple currency XRP; the third level is the community alliance made up of many Banks and financial institutions. The members of the alliance are also involved in the operation of Ripple blockchain.

As a typical Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, the global payment network established by Ripple is a cross-bank electronic transfer system established in accordance with international standards. Its main application is transnational remittance. Ripple uses common network architecture to link independent networks in different regions, and adopts blockchain technology to realize real-time settlement, safe transaction and efficient settlement. Ripple primarily transfers money through Ripple Coin RXP, which exist in the form of a value that allows any currency in the world to pay for transactions. 

Based on academic research, currently Ripple platform can reduce international payment cost by about 33%. If Ripple currency is used as the intermediary currency, it can save 42% for international payment. It can be seen that Ripple has obvious advantages in payment. By the end of 2016, a number of British Banks and financial institutions have introduced Ripple to optimize cross-border business, and dozens of large Banks involved in more than 60 countries around the world have signed cooperation agreements with Ripple.

### 2.2 Major Components of Ripple Ecology
Ripple Company is the core of Ripple Ecology as the inventor of Ripple Protocol, main contributor of open source code and the core operator of Ripple Block Chain Network. Besides, it also provides technical support for open source software, such as operational developer portal. In addition, Ripple also provides commercial products to help financial institutions or companies access to the Ripple Block Chain Network. Ripple company also holds a large number of Ripple currency.

Ripple coin RXP is a cryptocurrency issued by blockchain technology, but only used as the medium of exchange within the Ripplr blockchain network. Ripple company is the manager of RXP. A total of 100 billion Ripple coins were issued at first. Different from bitcoin and ether coins, which were issued gradually over time, all the 100 billion Ripple coins were issued directly at the time of creation and will never be issued again according to the rules. Its founders, the founding team of Ripple, left themselves 20 billion, leaving another 80 billion to manage. Today, Ripple company still owns more than 60% of Ripple coins, which is slightly different with the decentralization characteristic of other blockchain coin like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. The price of XRP is shown as follows.

### 2.3 Specific Solution Scenarios
* 	Cross-border money transfer system -- application of blockchain
One of the payment solutions Ripple offers to banks is cross-border remittances. Banks and other financial institutions use its enterprise-level software, called xCurrent, to solve the problem of long-time and costly cross-border transfers. Cross-border remittance doesn’t really involve the cross-border flow of funds, but mainly relies on the SWIFT system for information transmission, and then finish clearing and each bank updates its own account book to complete the settlement. Ripple's xCurrent software is based on blockchain real-time settlement to reduce the cost of cross-border remittances.

The cross-border remittance process with xCurrent software of two banks is shown in the following figure, which is generally divided into two stages. First, two banks exchange information through messengers. Then two banks conduct ledger processing through Ripple's ILP ledger, foreign exchange quotation and verifier, and complete the settlement of funds on the blockchain ledger. When using the xCurrent software for cross-border transfers, the distributed ledger technology of the blockchain is applied, but not the cryptocurrency XRP.

To be specific, there are five processes for making a transnational remittance using Ripple's xCurrent system:

* Official introduction in [Ripple website] (https://ripple.com/)
For banks, Ripple has realized real-time global payments across 27 countries and banks can join RippleNet to process cross-border payments in real time with end-to-end tracking and certainty and also expand payments offerings into new markets that are otherwise too difficult or expensive to reach.

## 3. Pros and Cons of Blockchain-based Payment System
With block chain technology as the cornerstone, this new payment system can achieve many effects that traditional payment methods can’t achieve.
* Conducive to reducing payment costs            
The traditional payment system has higher transaction costs, especially for construction of centralization system and customer data system. Even if the electronic payment such as WeChat and Alipay has reduced the cost to a large extent, the rigidity cost of centralized system can’t be eliminated. Based on block chain technology, the cost of payment system will be greatly reduced like the data transfer costs and centralized data processing cost. Quoting from a Santander Bank, Blockchain-based payment system could help banking industry save $15 billion to $20 billion a year by reducing cross-border payments and compliance costs.
* Conducive to improving payment efficiency            
Cross-bank payments, large payments, off-site payments, cross-border payments, etc., usually take a long time and is expensive. Payment and settlement systems in some countries are inefficient and complex. A remittance may take up to three days, which is extremely inefficient and cost-effective. Block chain technology doesn’t require banks or third-party payment agencies, allowing both sides to achieve cross-border payment quickly and freely through peer-to-peer mode. Also, the blockchain-based payment is 24-hour available and has realized real-time account arrival.
* Conductive to payment safety
Under blockchain-based payment system, customer information and transaction records are reliable and can’t be modified. The relevant regulators can analyze and detect customer transactions in real time by shared information, and detect illegal acts such as money laundering and fraud in time. Peer to Peer transaction solves the uncertain factors in cross-border payment caused by third-party payment, like time lag and exchange rate changes.

However, the blockchain-based payment system has certain risks in technology, resources, legal supervision and so on.           
* Lack rules and regulations            
At present, there are no formal rules and regulations for blockchain-based payment system. The decentralization and autonomy of blockchain technology has largely dilutes the role of government departments. In addition, the lack of uniform standards for block chain technology worldwide also increases market risk.
* High cost of infrastructure investment            
Blockchain technology puts forward higher requirements for hardware, network and other infrastructure construction. In the early stage of construction, the cost of investment is relatively high, including the purchase of hardware equipment and the expenditure of R&D expenses, while the expected benefits of these high costs are so uncertain.
* Existence of technical problems            
In the early stage of application, block chain technology is not yet mature, and there are still many bottlenecks that need to be broken through. And the capacity of block chains also needs to keep up with the demand of data information base.
* Customer Viscosity of Existing Electronic Payment Platforms            
At present, the third-party payment platform has occupied the vast majority of the electronic payment market and customers have formed their payment habits within the integration of electronic payment platform and e-commerce platform, which is difficult to change in the short term.
* Public Understanding and Identity            
Blockchain, as a new high-tech concept, is not well understood by the public and relevant institutions. Because of its complex algorithmic concepts, many people are discouraged, resulting in its low recognition and limited market acceptance.

## 4. The Future of Blockchain-based Payment System
In the future, with the continuous extension of block chain technology, the government should take the lead to improve the relevant laws of electronic payment, guide the technological innovation of block chain, and better drive the healthy development of electronic payment system under block chain. Specifically speaking, the following points should be done to help build and improve blockchain-based payment system.
* Actively promote legislative work and legal construction of blockchain-based payment system            
* Accelerating the research and development of block chain technology in payment system            
* Increase investment in infrastructure construction of blockchain-based payment system            
* Focus more on public education and personnel training of blockchain            
* Deepening international cooperation, establishing international alliances and establishing a coherent system worldwide
After successfully building the blockchain-based payment system, further development trends include overall optimization of intelligent contract, intelligent regulatory procedure and codification, electronic payment process integration based on block chain, digital currency replacing real currency and so on.
