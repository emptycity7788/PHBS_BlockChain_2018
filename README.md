# Research on the Impact of Blockchain on the Business Model of Payment Industry - Based on Blockchain Applications
## 1.	Possibility of Block Chain Application in Payment Industry and Comparison with Traditional Payment
Block chain technology, originating from Bitcoin proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, is a bottom application technology of Bitcoin and also known as distributed book-keeping technology. Block chain refers to a technical scheme that collectively generates a series of ordered data blocks by means of mathematical algorithms in the way of de-centralization and de-trust, and constitutes a reliable database. The scheme allows any number of user nodes in the system to compute and record data for a period of time through a specific cryptographic algorithm into a data block, and to use the keys generated by the data block to link and verify the next data blockchain. 

Block chain technology, as the underlying technology support, has a huge possibility and potential to integrate with payment means and even bring huge changes to them. This possibility mainly stems from its characteristics of decentralization, de-trust and de-risk. It can well solve the problems of high network security risk, low credit, lack of legal supervision and high payment cost in current electronic payment industry. Specifically speaking, the following points demonstrate its main potentials.
* Blockchain-based electronic payment system can help realize trust interaction between transaction parties under block-chain digital signature technology, bypassing information intermediary through peer-to-peer transaction.
* Blockchain, using intelligent contract instead of traditional contract, can help avoid contract execution accidents caused by human emotional factors.
* Blockchain can help overall supervision and realize intelligent supervision through credit information management system, and also simplify electronic payment process. 
* Block chains can help achieve high security and user protection. Based on the characteristics of distributed bookkeeping in block chain, the work related to privacy and security, such as authentication, proof of rights and interests, intelligent assets, etc., can be effectively reformed.
If the blockchain-based payment system could be achieved finally, the system should be as shown in the following figure:

Compared with traditional payment system, blockchain-based payment system mainly has following features.
